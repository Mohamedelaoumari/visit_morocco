                will allow you to forget all modern life stress and live an

                Erg Chigaga in the sahara desert of Morocco. During your luxury
                desert tour, you will spend the 1st night on your way to the

                You will have your private luxurious tent with toilets
                and hot water shower inside. The tents are beautifully and
                authentically designed. You will be amazed by the Berber touch of
                each piece in your luxury tent. Your comfort is also guaranteed.
                You will have everything like you are in a 5 stars hotel in the
                middle of nowhere. The food is also delicious and typically Moroccan.
